# DataVis_EnrollmentTrends

This project was completed in my Data Visualization class (Data 201) during my Junior year (Fall 2023). The project was created using a William and Mary Undergraduate dataset. Utilizing this dataset, I created two visualizations in Tableau to explore trends in undergraduate enrollment counts over 10 years as well as major/ minor trends.
